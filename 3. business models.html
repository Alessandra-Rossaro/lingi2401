#Create a software
- Name?
- Use?
- Target users?
- Selling point?
- Distribution model?
- Business model?

???
Choose your license accordingly. Proprietary licenses are fine.

Take into account the initial developement time and the maintenance, including new versions.

#Wikipedia, Framasoft
- Donations only
- Patreon, Tipeee, Flattr, Liberapay, OpenCollective

???
The donation business model can be creatively exploited. The Sublime text editor, for example, use an "infinite trial version" to encourage you to buy a definitive version. The author, on his blog, use the term "free price" which has been popularized as "prix libre".

Many donation platforms have appeared: Patreon and Tipeee, for monthly recurring donations, Flattr, very original but currently evolving, Liberapay for weekly recurring donation with a special focus on free software or Open Collective.

#ICO
- Initial Coin Offering
- Mostly for blockchain related projects
- Makes sense only if a token makes sense in the project
- Currently overused
- Will probably replace completely traditional investment rounds

#Conclusion
- Always ask the question "If I'm not paying for it, who is paying?"
- Today, the challenge seems to be very similar for proprietary software
